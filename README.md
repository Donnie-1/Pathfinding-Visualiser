# Pathfinding Visualizer
Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. It is built with React and is available at https://pathfinding-visualiser.vercel.app/

# Demonstration 
Click and hold to create walls or generate a random maze and then select from one of three algorithms (more coming soon) to be visualised. 

Algorithms available are: 
- Dijkstra's 
- DFS 
- Bidirectional BFS
